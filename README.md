## Troubleshooting

### Issues when getting the cookie and tokens initially
If you still use the E-Mail or SMS based 2FA flow, then this might not work. Please update the 2FA/OTP method in the amazon settings to the current process.

If you open the Proxy URL from a mobile device where also the Alexa App is installed on, it might be that it does not work because Amazon might open the Alexa App. So please use a device or PC where the Alexa App is not installed

If you see a page that tells you that "alexa.amazon.xx is deprecated" and you should use the alexa app and with a QR code on it when you enter the Proxy URL" then this means that you call the proxy URL ith a different IP/Domainname then you entered in the "proxy own IP" settings, or you adjusted the IP shown in the Adapter configuration. The "proxy own IP" setting **needs to** match the IP/Domainname you use to call the proxy URL!

### Push Connections do not connect
Sometimes it could happen that because of too many connection tries aAmazon blocks the push connection endpoint for a specific IP and "device".

If the Push connection is never established, then you can try to use the following:
* delete all cookies, formerRegistrationData and macDms from the settings
* locale the location of the alexa-cookie2 library in your npm tree
* check if there is a file like .../alexa-cookie2/lib/formerDataStore.json - if existing please delete them
* get new cookie via proxy

Then it should work again

Partly based on [Amazon Alexa Remote Control](http://blog.loetzimmer.de/2017/10/amazon-alexa-hort-auf-die-shell-echo.html) (PLAIN shell) and [alexa-remote-control](https://github.com/thorsten-gehrig/alexa-remote-control) and [OpenHab-Addon](https://github.com/openhab/openhab2-addons/blob/f54c9b85016758ff6d271b62d255bbe41a027928/addons/binding/org.openhab.binding.amazonechocontrol)
Thank you for that work.

(e.g. activityStatus, deviceAccountId ...) Also in the amazon data some fields are no longer existing (e.g. domainAttributes ...)
